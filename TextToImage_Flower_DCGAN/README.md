How To Run The Jupyer Notebook : Please Download data from the following link and put it in the jupyer notebook folder and then simply run all cells of notebook [link]([flowers.hdf5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ez6GvbE1isWzGtD1h9oocheM6YcBGJoh/view?usp=sharing]) File Name : "flowers.hdf5"
Note : It is not necessary to run the notebook, it already has all the results with visualizations inside it.


Details of the Project Repository:
- DCGAN_Flower_Image.ipynb is the final notebook and the one that needs to be run and evaluated.
-  flowers.hdf5: These are the improved version of word2vec text embeddings for the text input data.
- The Notebook contains all the instructions to run the notebook. // Just Run all Cells
- checkpoints: This folder consists of the final generator and discriminator model after 100 Epochs of training and can be used as a pretrained model.
- results: This folder consists of images generated by dcgan on training, validation and test split.
-  epoch_loss.csv: This consists of the generator and discriminator losses for the number of training epochs.
